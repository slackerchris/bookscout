# BookScout Changelog

## [0.37.0] - 2026-03-21

> **Filesystem scanner + library path management.**  BookScout can now detect
> owned audiobooks directly from local library directories, without requiring
> Audiobookshelf.  ABS and filesystem ownership checks work together — whichever
> fires first marks the book as owned.

### Added
- **`core/scanner.py`** — async filesystem scanner
  - Walks configured library path directories for audio files (`.m4b`, `.mp3`,
    `.flac`, `.opus`, `.aac`, `.ogg`, `.wma`, `.m4a`)
  - Parses author + title from directory structure (supports ABS standard layout,
    single-file books, nested series folders, and `Author - Title` filename pattern)
  - Matches found files against DB books using `author_names_match` + word-overlap
    title similarity (≥ 0.75 threshold)
  - Matched books updated: `have_it=True`, `match_method='filesystem'`,
    `file_path=<directory>`
  - Deduplicates multi-part books (multiple files in same folder = one match)
  - Updates `LibraryPath.last_scanned` timestamp on completion
- **`api/v1/library_paths.py`** — library path REST API
  - `GET /api/v1/library-paths` — list all configured paths with scan status
  - `POST /api/v1/library-paths` — register a new path (validates existence)
  - `DELETE /api/v1/library-paths/{id}` — remove a path
  - `POST /api/v1/library-paths/{id}/scan` — enqueue filesystem scan for one path
  - `POST /api/v1/library-paths/scan-all` — enqueue scan for all enabled paths
- **`workers/tasks.py`** — two new arq tasks
  - `scan_library_path_task(library_path_id)` — scan a single path
  - `scan_all_library_paths_task()` — scan all enabled paths sequentially
- **`workers/settings.py`** — both new tasks registered in `WorkerSettings.functions`

### Changed
- `main.py`: mounted `/api/v1/library-paths` router; bumped `version` to `0.37.0`
- `VERSION` → `0.37.0`
- `REFACTOR_PLAN.md`: roadmap table updated — all completed versions marked ✅,
  v0.40.0 marked as next target

---

## [0.32.1] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- **Audnexus API broken** (`core/metadata.py`): The `/search?name=` endpoint returns
  HTTP 404.  `query_audnexus()` rewritten to use the Audible catalog API
  (`api.audible.com/1.0/catalog/products`) for audiobook discovery (paginated,
  up to 200 books per author) with Audnexus `/books/{asin}` for per-book enrichment
  (cover, ISBN, release date, series). Result: 0 → 199 audiobooks for Brandon Sanderson.
- **Language normalisation** (`core/metadata.py`): Audnexus returns full language
  names (`"english"`, `"german"`); these are now mapped to ISO 639-1 codes (`"en"`,
  `"de"`) to match the `language_filter` convention. The `language_filter` parameter
  was previously accepted but silently ignored — it now correctly filters results.
- **Default `language_filter`** (`config.yaml.example`, `core/scan.py`): Changed
  from `"all"` to `"en"` so new deployments default to English-only results.

---

## [0.32.2] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- **`author_names_match()` missed spaced-initial variants** (`core/normalize.py`):
  `"J.N. Chaney"` normalized to the single token `"jn"`, while `"J. N. Chaney"`
  normalized to `["j", "n"]` — the existing initials logic could never reconcile
  these. Added `_expand_initials()` which splits 2–3 character all-consonant
  non-last tokens back into individual initials before comparison. Now matches:
  `J.N. Chaney` ↔ `J. N. Chaney`, `John N. Chaney`, `Jason N. Chaney`,
  `J.R.R. Tolkien` ↔ `J. R. R. Tolkien` ↔ `John Ronald Reuel Tolkien`.
  No false positives introduced (`James Chaney`, `Jordan Chaney` still `False`).

---

## [0.32.0] - 2026-03-21

- **Config system** (`config.py`, `config.yaml.example`):
  - Reads `config.yaml` (path via `BOOKSCOUT_CONFIG` env var, default `/data/config.yaml`)
  - Deep-merges with hard-coded defaults then layers env var overrides
  - Covers: database, redis, audiobookshelf, prowlarr, jackett, APIs, download clients, scan schedule
- **CLI** (`cli.py`): typer-based command-line interface
  - `python cli.py scan --author-id <id>` — in-process single-author scan
  - `python cli.py scan --all` — in-process full-watchlist scan

---

## [0.31.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **PostgreSQL support**: Full async schema via SQLAlchemy 2.0 + asyncpg
  - Proper relational schema replaces SQLite flat tables
  - Many-to-many `book_authors` join table with `role` discriminator (`author` / `co-author` / `narrator`) — replaces legacy `co_authors` JSON blob
  - `watchlist` table separates "monitored authors" from raw author records
  - `library_paths`, `webhooks`, `webhook_deliveries` tables added for upcoming v0.37 and v0.35 features
  - Full index set on hot query paths (`isbn13`, `confidence_band`, `have_it`, `name_sort`, `author_id`)
- **Alembic migrations** (`alembic.ini`, `db/migrations/`): Version-controlled schema management
  - Async-compatible `env.py` using `asyncpg`
  - `DATABASE_URL` env var overrides `alembic.ini` (Docker-friendly)
  - Initial migration `0001_initial_schema.py` creates all tables with `alembic upgrade head`
- **SQLite → PostgreSQL migration script** (`scripts/migrate_sqlite.py`)
  - Idempotent: safe to re-run; skips already-migrated records
  - Migrates authors, books, watchlist; explodes legacy `co_authors` JSON → `book_authors` rows
  - `--dry-run` flag validates and counts without writing
  - Usage: `python scripts/migrate_sqlite.py --sqlite /data/bookscout.db --postgres postgresql://...`
- **Docker Compose** updated with PostgreSQL 16 + Redis 7 services
  - Health checks on both services; bookscout `depends_on` both
  - `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` env var (default: `bookscout` — change in production)
  - Named volumes: `postgres-data`, `redis-data`, `bookscout-data`
- **`db/models.py`**: SQLAlchemy async ORM models (used by Alembic and future FastAPI service)
- **`db/session.py`**: Async engine + `AsyncSessionFactory` + `get_session()` FastAPI dependency

### Note
`app.py` continues running on SQLite for this version. The PostgreSQL schema is established and data migration tooling is ready. The Flask → FastAPI cutover happens in v0.33.0.

---

## [0.30.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **Confidence Scoring Engine** (`confidence.py`): Scores merged book results to surface the most reliable matches
  - Multi-signal scoring: exact/normalized title match, author match (exact + fuzzy), ISBN match, publication year, provider count, audiobook format
  - ISBN match awards +100 points; multi-provider presence adds up to +35 points
  - Penalty system: bad-keyword detection (-60) for summaries/workbooks/companions, suspicious edition mismatch (-25) for abridged/illustrated/movie tie-in editions
  - Results bucketed into `high` (≥100), `medium` (50–99), and `low` (<50) confidence bands
  - Each scored book carries `score`, `confidence_band`, and `score_reasons` fields for transparency and debugging
- **Confidence Integration** (`app.py`): `score_books()` wired into `scan_author()` pipeline
  - Called after `merge_books()`, results sorted by score descending before ABS check loop
  - DB migration: `score`, `confidence_band`, `score_reasons` columns added to `books` table (auto-migrates on startup)
  - Both INSERT and UPDATE paths persist score data
- **Confidence Badges** (`author.html`): Visual confidence indicator on every book card
  - Green = high (≥100), yellow = medium (50–99), red = low (<50)
  - Raw score shown in tooltip on hover
- **Confidence Integration Guide** (`CONFIDENCE_INTEGRATION.py`): Reference patch instructions
- **Confidence Test Suite** (`test_confidence.py`): Unit tests covering scoring rules and edge cases
- **Updated Roadmap** (`REFACTOR_PLAN.md`): Full v0.30→v0.40 staged plan — FastAPI + arq + Redis + PostgreSQL service architecture
